# Appointment Companion changelog

## v2.44 - 4th October 2026

- Added Cloud-backed Partner profiles as the reusable identity layer for multiple Companion users.
- Partner profiles now support Partner ID, name, UW join link, mobile, email, town, strapline, photo URL, booking URL, website URL and active status.
- Added the live Partner admin console for creating and editing Partner profiles and resetting passwords.
- Partner details hydrate onto a device after login while remaining cached locally for offline use.
- EV and Should I Fix sharing now carries the creating Partner ID so public views can resolve the correct Partner branding.
- Retained the v2.43 trusted-device login behaviour.
- Bumped the PWA asset/cache version so installed copies fetch the new profile and sharing code.

## v2.43 - 4th October 2026

- Trusted-device login persistence: a verified Companion Login ID and Password are retained on that device across normal browser, phone and installed-PWA restarts.
- Session authentication is automatically rehydrated from the trusted-device credential.
- Temporary Cloud, network or Apps Script failures no longer clear a verified device login.
- Explicit disconnect, a genuine authentication rejection, or clearing the device's site/app data still removes the trusted-device credential.
- PWA asset/cache version bumped so existing installations fetch the corrected authentication shell.

## v2.42

- Added true local/Cloud discrepancy handling and multi-customer deletion.
- Continued consolidated local-first customer and specialist-tool architecture.
